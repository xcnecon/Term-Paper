For a derivation of the equation, please refer to *Determinants of the Profit Rates in the OECD Economies* (Trofimov, 2022). A more stylized derivation can be found in *Where Profits Come From* (Levy, 2008). In short, much like the GDP equation, the Kalecki-Levy equation is an accounting identity for aggregate corporate profit in an economy. I would add more explanation of the equation in my proposal and future drafts. 

Regarding the 'behavioral relation,' what I mean is that I want to build a model that shows the relationships among the data items (corporate profit, net private investment, net exports, government deficit, dividends, and household savings) in the NIPA. Therefore, the regression model I derive from the NIPA might differ from the Kalecki-Levy equation, such as: Profit = 0.9 Net Investment + 1.1 Net Exports + 0.8 Government Deficit + 0.8 Dividends - 0.7 Household Savings, rather than having all coefficients equal to 1. Additionally, if I control for time effects and seasonality, the model I generate might look different from the original Kalecki-Levy equation. I will also attempt to use percentage changes in these variables to structure the regression model. The ultimate goal of this project will be to test how well variations in the independent variables explain fluctuations in aggregate corporate profit.

Thank you, Fernando, for your advice on the use of time series analysis and data collection. I am not familiar with time series analysis, so I might need to reconsider whether and how to apply it to my project after gaining more knowledge on the subject.
